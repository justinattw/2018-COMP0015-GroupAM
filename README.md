# 2018-COMP0015-GroupAM

This is the Git repository for Group AM, team members Antonin Kanat and Justin Wong.

deliverable2.py will run the main program.

This repository also includes two unit test files (person_test, project_test) that we have used to carry out unit testing throughout the development of this program.


# COMP0015 Deliverable 2 – 1 page report 
by Antonin Kanat and Justin Wong

Instructions
This is a terminal-based program written in Python 3. The program starts in a main menu. As of deliverable 2, four components of the menu are accessible to the user - ‘About’, ‘Create Project’, ‘Enter Votes’, and ‘Quit’.

A fifth component, ‘Show Projects’, is not fully available yet. However, it is currently included to display a dictionary containing created projects, with information on team size, team members and their assigned votes. We have included this to allow assessors to simply see how we have stored the data.

Python style guide
We wrote our code according to the Style Guide for Python Code, utilising snake_case and block comments. Each function has a short block comment describing its features. We intended to write a code that is easily readable, as well as chronological for it to be easy to follow.

Files
For Deliverable 2, files are split into 3 primary files:
‘deliverable2.py’		main program, runs Spliddit
‘person.py’ 		module containing Person class
‘Project.py’		module containing Project class
Two further test files for Person and Project classes are included, denoted by file name beginning ‘test_’.

Additional challenges
Github: We started a Github repository to make collaboration easier, as both members can commit and pull files to work collaboratively virtually. We worked in separate branches and at certain intervals merged files to the master branch. We used Atom IDE as GitHub is implemented within Atom.

Unit tests: We conducted unit tests on the modules ‘person.py’ and ‘project.py’ in order to ensure that class attribute inputs and validation methods were functioning as intended.

Edit votes: Currently, users may overwrite their vote entries by simply 

Testing
We test the program by running it personally and inputting unexpected and strange inputs to see how the program would handle. We also conduct unit tests on module files to ensure that inputs are handled by the program in an expected manner.
