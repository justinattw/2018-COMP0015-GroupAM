# 2018-COMP0015-GroupAM

This is the Git repository for Group AM, team members Antonin Kanat and Justin Wong.

In this repository, you will find three modules (person, project, deliverable2) defining two classes (Person, Project).

deliverable2.py will run the main program. It will call classes Person and Project from the modules person and project.

This repository also includes two unit test files (person_test, project_test) that we have used to carry out unit testing throughout the development of this program.
